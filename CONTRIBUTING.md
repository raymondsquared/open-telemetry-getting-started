# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

All types of contributions are encouraged and valued.

## Roadmap

We have some functionalities in mind and we have issued them and there is a _milestone_ label available on the issue. If there is a bug or a feature that is not listed in the **issues** page or there is no one assigned to the issue, feel free to fix/add it! Although it's better to discuss it in the issue or create a new issue for it so there is no confilcting code.

## Contribute

Contributing to a project on Github is pretty straight forward. If this is you're first time, these are the steps you should take.

### Bug/Issue

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions.
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

### Feature Request

Open an issue on GitHub once you have collected positive feedback about the change and tag it as **feature-request**.

### Code

Fork this repo.

If you're adding a new functionality, start from the branch **main**. It would be a better practice to create a new branch and work in there.

#### Branching Strategy

We use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), So all code changes happen through Pull Requests

#### Test

And that's it! Read the code available and change the part you don't like! You're change should not break the existing code and should pass the tests.

#### Commit Message

We follow [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) message guidelines to ensure clear, structured, and meaningful version control history.

#### Pull Request Body

When you're done, submit a pull request and for one of the maintainers to check it out. We would let you know if there is any problem or any changes that should be considered.
